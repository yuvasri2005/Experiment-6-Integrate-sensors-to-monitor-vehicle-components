## AIM
To develop an embedded IoT-based predictive maintenance system for an electric vehicle by integrating sensors that monitor battery health, motor temperature, and brake wear and analyze the data for maintenance prediction.
 
## PROCEDURE
1.	Simulate Sensor Data 
o	Generate battery health, motor temperature, and brake wear data.
2.	Analyze Trends 
o	Detect if any sensor crosses predefined maintenance thresholds.
3.	Predict Maintenance Needs 
o	If any component shows abnormal behavior, flag it for preventive maintenance.
4.	Visualize Data with Graphs 
o	Plot sensor readings and highlight maintenance limits.
5.	Display Alerts 
o	Output maintenance warnings based on real-time sensor data analysis.
 
## THEORY
1. Predictive Maintenance in EVs
•	Battery degradation over time affects range and efficiency.
•	Motor overheating can lead to failures if not detected early.
•	Brake wear monitoring ensures vehicle safety.
2. IoT and Data Analytics Role
•	Real-time monitoring of EV components using embedded sensors.
•	Threshold-based predictions help prevent breakdowns.
•	Graphs help visualize component performance over time.

## PROGRAM



 
## RESULT
✅ The MATLAB simulation successfully predicts maintenance needs in an electric vehicle.
✅ The system detects potential failures in battery, motor, and brakes.
✅ Graphical analysis provides a clear view of component health.
